# EXPERIMENTAL real-application MVP: implementation ledger

**This is a prototype, not certified Gate A2 evidence.** It shares no code path with the frozen Gate 2A supervisor and has none of its isolation: handlers run in-process, as the same OS user, against a disposable local PostgreSQL only.

| Starting commit | `ac6ff66a77afaf49a8f123d28c8619f37610f6be`: Gate A2.3, whose supervisor characterization ran once with 31 claims verified, 7 unobservable and 3 not tested |
| Untouched | frozen Gate 2A, Gate A1, WorkloadSpec v2, the Gate A2 demonstration guard (still blocked), all historical evidence |
| New code | `src/deployspecter/experimental/` only; tests in `tests/experimental/`; `research_tools/mvp_pg.sh` |

## Scope of the prototype

1. `stepping.py`: real handlers on psycopg 3, one `SteppedConnection` per actor thread, a deterministic controller, lock-wait detection through `pg_blocking_pids`, bounded exploration, and provenance for every operation.
2. `apps/reservations_mixed.py`: a trusted mixed-version fixture with old and new handlers, an expand migration with a sync trigger, and a buggy and a fixed backfill.
3. `oracle.py`: independent invariants I1 to I4, plus a typed state digest.
4. `workloads.py`: the `ds-mvp-workload/1` schema, its deterministic validator, and two deterministic sources (curated, systematic).
5. `muse.py`: Muse proposals through the same validator.
6. `harness.py`: a verified initial state, one run, and exploration.
